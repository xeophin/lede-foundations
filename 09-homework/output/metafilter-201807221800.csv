She began painting in an era when women didn‚Äôt, at an age when most people shouldn‚Äôt, traveling to remote locations that few professional adventurers chose to go. Not only did she adopt the painting techniques of modernism, when such ideas were considered dangerous, Carr chronicled the extraordinary art and culture of native peoples, who were invisible to the dominant culture, as described in the documentary Winds of Heaven (documentary trailer).","Emily Carr, a Canadian artist of stunning originality and strength",https://www.metafilter.com/175487/Emily-Carr-a-Canadian-artist-of-stunning-originality-and-strength

Real numbers can be paired up in a particular way to form 'complex numbers', first studied in 16th-century Italy , that behave like coordinates on a 2-D plane. Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing is like translating and rotating positions around the plane. Complex numbers, suitably paired, form 4-D 'quaternions', discovered in 1843 by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton, who on the spot ecstatically chiseled the formula into Dublin's Broome Bridge. John Graves, a lawyer friend of Hamilton's, subsequently showed that pairs of quaternions make octonions : numbers that define coordinates in an abstract 8-D space .""

elementary does not mean easy to understand. Elementary means that very
