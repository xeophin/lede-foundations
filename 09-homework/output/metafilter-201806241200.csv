I'm a service writer, which means I'm the interface between customers (who are idiots) and the technicians (who are mostly felons). Think Tom Smykowski from Office Space. I will warn you ahead of time, I am not the hero of my stories, just the protagonist.

Their dark, yiddish-infused songs feel perfect for Trump's America, offering a witty, wise take on all the worst aspects of human nature. The accompanying music is utterly joyous, however. Among their best songs are March of the Jobless Corps Freedom is a Verb and The Butcher's Sher .",You Gotta Give The Butcher His Share,https://www.metafilter.com/174890/You-Gotta-Give-The-Butcher-His-Share

14 favorites (7 in the past 24 hours),"Octopath Traveler‚Äô Brings it Back to JRPG Basics [Goomba Stomp] ‚ÄúThe original Final Fantasy set the JRPG standard: heroes of good unite to combat the forces of evil. The NES‚Äô limitations necessitated a simplistic approach, but there‚Äôs no denying it was an effective one. As time passed, more games added to the laundry list of JRPG tropes. Players took on the roles of brighteyed youths yearning for adventure or stoic warriors heeding the call of duty. There‚Äôs a certain charm and familiarity that comes with revisiting these stories in different forms. Octopath Traveler, the upcoming Square Enix game on the Switch, capitalizes hard on that.

My male co-host and I were seated on two tall stools. As he chatted up the audience, the dress slowly crept up my legs. I spent the entire event balanced precariously at the edge of the stool, legs crossed, trying not to move too much so I wouldn‚Äôt inadvertently flash the audience.
