Ireland is famously green... But this summer it's been gripped by an unusual heatwave and a lengthy dry spell. Crops are fading in the drought. And the unusual weather circumstances made the remarkable photos possible.

But combine the dry spell with the aerial view, and suddenly the outline is obvious.","In Ireland, Drought And A Drone Revealed The Outline Of An Ancient Henge",https://www.metafilter.com/175330/In-Ireland-Drought-And-A-Drone-Revealed-The-Outline-Of-An-Ancient-Henge
