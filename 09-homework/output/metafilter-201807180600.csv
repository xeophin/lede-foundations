Liberals tend to see it as something that needs to be fixed. Socialists see it as something to be defeated. They say they do, anyway.

Instead, the entire continent was our cradle. In reviewing and summarizing recent  developments across multiple fields, 23 scientists pose the questions Did Our Species Evolve in Subdivided Populations across Africa, and Why Does It Matter? Researchers have determined that much of human DNA comes from Neanderthals, and at least two other hominid species .
