48 favorites (24 in the past 24 hours),"40 years ago, Shenzhen ( Wikipedia ) was a quiet market town ( China Underground ) of 30,000 people on the route of the Kowloon–Canton Railway. That changed ( China Daily then-and-now gallery ) in 1979 when Shenzhen was promoted to city-status and in 1980 designated China’s first Special Economic Zone (SEZ), as part of the institution of the policy of "" reform and opening "" ( The Diplomat ) in late 1979 when the SEZ was established. Its rapid growth is thanks to foreign investments ( Kaizen Corporate Services ltd. ) and technology. Letter from Shenzhen -- Chinese tech isn’t an imitation of its American counterpart.

18 favorites,"Tim Heidecker is running for District Attorney of San Bernardino County. Heidecker, formerly of the Tim & Eric duo, was driven into politics after being put on trial for the murder of twenty teenagers at his Electric Sun Music Festival, headlined by Heidecker's own hit electronica project DKR . After the unjust murder verdict put an end to his experiments in cutting-edge virtual reality TV programming , Heidecker found himself driven to seek the sort of justice his action-hero icon Jack Decker famously sought against terrorists and Count Dracula . (Decker's newest season seems to be motivated by Tim's murder trial, too, and by the shadowy foreign conspiracy that Tim claims was truly responsible for all those deaths.",I give this campaign ad five bags of popcorn.,https://www.metafilter.com/175451/I-give-this-campaign-ad-five-bags-of-popcorn

40 favorites (9 in the past 24 hours),"“Key to municipalism is the concept of “predistribution”. The idea is that, rather than attempting to correct malign economic outcomes through redistributive taxes and benefits, government and civil society can get it right the first time by inscribing better outcomes within the economy itself. These common forms of ownership spread democracy beyond the ballot box and challenge the idea that the economy is a realm for technocrats rather than citizens.... In Spain, however, governments are already getting to work rolling back waves of privatisation and building economic democracy within neoliberal urban landscapes. If municipalism is the key to cities built on broad-based ownership and democratic control, then examining how it has worked elsewhere – what knowledge can be borrowed, what theories should be drawn upon, and what is specific to particular places – will be formative to Labour’s own municipal socialist agenda.“ Who Owns The City ? Municpalism and communalism. When We Go Into Goverment, We All Go Into Goverment , UK Labour’s plan to undo 40 years of privatization and revanche via mass democracy.
