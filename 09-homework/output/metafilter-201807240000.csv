30 favorites,"The Hugo Awards and the World Science Fiction convention have been in crisis in recent years (documented in many Mefi posts linked below) as SF's equivalent of Gamergate abused the (easily abusable) nomination process. After rules changes implemented in 2016, the 2017 Hugo nominees were a diverse slate and the awards ultimately nearly swept by women, several of them women of color. The current 2018 ballot is also highly diverse, and many breathed a sigh of relief over a bullet finally dodged. And then the 2018 Worldcon released its proposed programming draft for review by participants. They variously: misgendered a participant ; failed to emphasize Hugo nominees in programming and told someone calling for more diversity that it wasn't of interest to enough of the attendance ; took programming suggested by people of color and left them out of it .

Worldcon's Programming committee has since taken down the  draft.",The puppies in the soul,https://www.metafilter.com/175520/The-puppies-in-the-soul

Real numbers can be paired up in a particular way to form 'complex numbers', first studied in 16th-century Italy , that behave like coordinates on a 2-D plane. Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing is like translating and rotating positions around the plane. Complex numbers, suitably paired, form 4-D 'quaternions', discovered in 1843 by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton, who on the spot ecstatically chiseled the formula into Dublin's Broome Bridge. John Graves, a lawyer friend of Hamilton's, subsequently showed that pairs of quaternions make octonions : numbers that define coordinates in an abstract 8-D space .""

This fourth major update will bring the game to the XBox One, and represents the biggest addition to the game's functionality since its launch in 2016 , including long-awaited multiplayer functionality: Resource gathering no longer feels quite so much of a chore when you've up to three other friends in a party; creative collaboration on building projects and the likes is a joy, and simply exploring the galaxy with friends in tow makes for a much less lonely place. And there are plenty of well-considered touches too, such as being able to mark points of interest for others to see, and easily dropping resources straight into friends' inventories.",No Man's Sky: The NEXT Update,https://www.metafilter.com/175511/No-Mans-Sky-The-NEXT-Update
