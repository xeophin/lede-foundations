It's like going to one of those long timeshare presentations before getting your free vacation: if you want to have fun, you have to suffer through boring torture first. That is... until now! My name is Jeff Kornberg, and I make ""How To Play"" board game tutorial videos on my channel called ""The Dragon's Tomb."" A lot of other YouTube channels currently make similar kinds of videos, but most of them get the rules wrong, go on too long, or have boring hosts who are nerdy. My channel aims to fix all that. Each one of my videos concisely covers all rules of each game, while being hosted by someone who isn't a nerd (me). I am planning on making a ""How To Play"" video for every board game that exists, so if you get a new game, please wait until I make a video for it before attempting to play.” [via: Kotaku ]",“Cards.
