The book was like a storm-glass in my imagination – large, wondrous and wild.""

16 favorites,"Haskell is most likely quite different from any language you've ever used before. In Haskell, we de-emphasise code that modifies data. Instead, we focus on functions that take immutable values as input and produce new values as output. Given the same inputs, these functions always return the same results. This is a core idea behind functional programming.",Why functional programming? Why Haskell?,https://www.metafilter.com/175355/Why-functional-programming-Why-Haskell
