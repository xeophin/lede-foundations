Instead, we focus on functions that take immutable values as input and produce new values as output. Given the same inputs, these functions always return the same results. This is a core idea behind functional programming.",Why functional programming? Why Haskell?,https://www.metafilter.com/175355/Why-functional-programming-Why-Haskell
