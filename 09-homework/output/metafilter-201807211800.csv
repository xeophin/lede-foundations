elementary does not mean easy to understand. Elementary means that very
little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it,
except to have an infinite amount of intelligence.  There may be a large
number of steps that hard to follow, but to each does not require already
knowing the calculus or Fourier transforms. -- Richard P. Feynman This video recounts a lecture by Richard Feynman giving an elementary demonstration of why planets orbit in ellipses.

8 favorites,"What Other Games Can Learn From the Bullet Hell Genre [Paste Magazine] “When you hear “bullet hell” what do you think of? It’s not a new term, but it’s gained increasing prominence in the mainstream games discussion over the last decade, and is often associated with any game with overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles. While these barrages of bullets are what immediately capture attention, the genre is better defined by the way that it forces players to react to space. Taking elements from it can create new, novel approaches to the way we play in already established genres. Like roguelikes, the bullet hell genre has also seen a small number of games do just that, growing a small niche into something more visible and influential. It’s also muddied definitions of what exactly the genre is, and the elements that make it unique. In the strictest sense, “bullet hell” is a sub-genre of scrolling shooters, often but not strictly vertically oriented, that focus on intricate patterns of enemy projectiles, often building to encounters where most of the available play space is blanketed in bullets.”",“intimidating whirlwinds of bullets...”,https://www.metafilter.com/175461/intimidating-whirlwinds-of-bullets
