The sleek vision of a society of merit and achievement, a revolution of the “outsiders” against the “insiders” has shown its true colors. Macronism is little more than seizure of the public interest by the French business elite.” The France of No Tomorrow (The Baffler) “The disparity between Paris and its banlieues is stark, and last year, when Emmanuel Macron took office, he promised, like presidents before him, to reduce urban inequalities.

Ireland is famously green... But this summer it's been gripped by an unusual heatwave and a lengthy dry spell. Crops are fading in the drought. And the unusual weather circumstances made the remarkable photos possible. 

In normal weather, the difference is undetectable — that's why Murphy had flown drones overhead before without noticing it. And even in a drought, it's too subtle to see from the ground. But combine the dry spell with the aerial view, and suddenly the outline is obvious.","In Ireland, Drought And A Drone Revealed The Outline Of An Ancient Henge",https://www.metafilter.com/175330/In-Ireland-Drought-And-A-Drone-Revealed-The-Outline-Of-An-Ancient-Henge
