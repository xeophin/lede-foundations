70 favorites (28 in the past 24 hours),"On June 19th, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger of the United States Army arrived in Galveston, Texas . One of the orders he issued was GENERAL ORDER #3 : The people are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property, between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them, become that between employer and hired labor. What Is Juneteenth? , Henry Louis Gates, Jr. When Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger issued the above order, he had no idea that, in establishing the Union Army‚Äôs authority over the people of Texas, he was also establishing the basis for a holiday, ‚ÄúJuneteenth‚Äù (‚ÄúJune‚Äù plus ‚Äúnineteenth‚Äù), today the most popular annual celebration of emancipation from slavery in the United States. After all, by the time Granger assumed command of the Department of Texas, the Confederate capital in Richmond had fallen; the ‚ÄúExecutive‚Äù to whom he referred, President Lincoln, was dead; and the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was well on its way to ratification.

But Granger wasn‚Äôt just a few months late. The Emancipation Proclamation itself, ending slavery in the Confederacy (at least on paper), had taken effect two-and-a-half years before, and in the interim, close to 200,000 black men had enlisted in the fight. So, formalities aside, wasn‚Äôt it all over, literally, but the shouting?",Juneteenth,https://www.metafilter.com/174810/Juneteenth

[Polygon] ‚ÄúGame publishers are lathering their productions with the stark imagery of modern political divisions, while at the same time denying any topical intent. Their strategy, according to industry sources ranging from developers to publicists, is to profit from emotive societal divisions, while ducking difficult conversations about what their works might signify. Their games garner publicity and a sense of cultural relevance, but the companies avoid the challenge and expense of controversy. In the words of one senior game industry publicist I spoke to, under conditions of anonymity: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bullshit. They want to have their cake and eat it too.‚Äù In the past few years, we‚Äôve seen repeated examples of the quasi-political AAA game. ‚Äù",‚Äúeasier to take the line that the work is open to many interpretations‚Äù,https://www.metafilter.com/174820/easier-to-take-the-line-that-the-work-is-open-to-many-interpretations

38 favorites (7 in the past 24 hours),"Die Sendung mit der Maus (German link) is the oldest kids' show on German TV - it first aired in 1971. Its main charm was its unhurried, affirming and positive approach to children's stories and children's questions. Despite multiple makeovers, the basic format remains the same: each episode has animated shorts (Lachgeschichten) and documentaries about everyday things (Sachgeschichten).  But most of all, we children loved the Maus Spots that separated the individual blocks from each other: charming, wordless adventures of a very big, orange mouse and a very small, purple elephant. The best thing is: It's all available online and if your kids are like mine, they will love Mouse and Elephant, too.",The Show with the Mouse,https://www.metafilter.com/174799/The-Show-with-the-Mouse
