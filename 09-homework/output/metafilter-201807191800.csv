Despite stateside hopes, the sarcophagus is unlikely to contain any Elder Gods. It is also unlikely to contain Alexander the Great, even though he was said to have been reburied in a sealed coffin","""I'm pinning all my hopes on the creature in the sarcophagus.""",https://www.metafilter.com/175417/Im-pinning-all-my-hopes-on-the-creature-in-the-sarcophagus

The idea is that, rather than attempting to correct malign economic outcomes through redistributive taxes and benefits, government and civil society can get it right the first time by inscribing better outcomes within the economy itself. These common forms of ownership spread democracy beyond the ballot box and challenge the idea that the economy is a realm for technocrats rather than citizens.... In Spain, however, governments are already getting to work rolling back waves of privatisation and building economic democracy within neoliberal urban landscapes. If municipalism is the key to cities built on broad-based ownership and democratic control, then examining how it has worked elsewhere – what knowledge can be borrowed, what theories should be drawn upon, and what is specific to particular places – will be formative to Labour’s own municipal socialist agenda.“ Who Owns The City ? Municpalism and communalism. When We Go Into Goverment, We All Go Into Goverment , UK Labour’s plan to undo 40 years of privatization and revanche via mass democracy.
