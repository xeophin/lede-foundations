58 favorites,"If you want to know why women are so angry, it’s because this ritual tends to exclude the injured party. This “talk about how you’re going to do and be better” stuff isn’t actually a great formula for reconciliation. It offers neither retributive nor restorative justice. It privileges public acceptance over making things right with the actual victims, who barely seem to register at all. But it’s pretty effective: In an age of never-ending public relations wars, we’re so starved for any sign of sincere spiritual struggle that we rush to reward self-proclaimed sinners who say they’re trying to make good.",a reckoning can’t begin and end with the self.,https://www.metafilter.com/175130/a-reckoning-cant-begin-and-end-with-the-self

She noted that it had cost her £25 already that week and that the annual average cost of menstrual products in the UK per person is £500. Rowley then called for action to address the issue of period poverty in the UK.

14 favorites,"How video games demonize fat people [The Outline] “When I encounter the fat body in a video game, the disappointment that follows is so hot and pure that there is, as a matter of self-care, an urgent need to remove myself from the moment and get on a plane. I refuse to accept that in the world of prestige video games — AAA in industry speak — a body like mine and those of the people I love and admire, can only exist in one of two ways: a cheap laugh or a site of disgust, usually both. [...] In 2018, the AAA video game remains our most persuasive and powerful cultural product. And yet it almost exclusively depicts the fat body, my body, as a noxious threat, a monstrosity, an object of ridicule, something to be dealt with violently.”",“What if the fault lies in the nature of the corporate product itself?”,https://www.metafilter.com/175145/What-if-the-fault-lies-in-the-nature-of-the-corporate-product-itself
247 favorites (13 in the past 24 hours),"You invest so much in it, don't you? It's what elevates you above the beasts of the field, it's what makes you special . Homo sapiens , you call yourself. Wise Man. Do you even know what it is , this consciousness you cite in your own exaltation? Do you even know what it's for? Dr. Peter Watts is no stranger to MetaFilter. But look past his sardonic nuptials , heartbreaking eulogies , and agonizing run-ins with fascists (and fasciitis ) and you'll find one of the most brilliant, compelling, and disquieting science fiction authors at work today. A marine biologist skilled at deep background research, his acclaimed 2006 novel Blindsight [ full text ] -- a cerebral ""first contact"" tale led by a diverse crew of bleeding-edge post-humans -- is diamond-hard and deeply horrifying, wringing profound existential dread from such abstruse concepts as the Chinese Room , the Philosophical Zombie , Chernoff faces , and the myriad quirks and blind spots that haunt the human mind.

But Blindsight 's last, shattering insight is not the end of the story -- along with crew / ship / ""Firefall"" notes , a blackly funny in-universe lecture on resurrecting sociopathic vampirism ( PDF - prev. ), and a rigorously-cited (and spoiler-laden) reference section , tomorrow will see the release of Dumbspeech State of Grace Echopraxia [ website ] , the long-delayed ""sidequel"" depicting parallel events on Earth. Want more? Look inside for a guide to the rest of Watts' award-winning (and provocative) body of work.","If we're not in pain, we're not alive",https://www.metafilter.com/142209/If-were-not-in-pain-were-not-alive
