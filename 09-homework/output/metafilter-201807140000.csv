'Americans know as much about Canada as straight people do about gays,' he purred to camera as his foppish alter ego Buddy Cole. So it’s no surprise that one of Thompson’s favorite sketch troupes of all time, CODCO, also reveled in their regional identity.""",Pleasant priests in conversation,https://www.metafilter.com/175301/Pleasant-priests-in-conversation

15 favorites,"In 2005, Metzinger put on a virtual-reality head-mounted display. Inside, he saw his own body, facing away from him, standing in a room. He watched as Lenggenhager stroked its back. Metzinger could feel the stroking, but the body to which it was happening seemed to be situated in front of him. He felt a strange sensation, as though he were drifting in space, or being stretched between the two bodies. He wanted to jump entirely into the body before him, but couldn’t. He seemed marooned outside of himself. It wasn’t quite an out-of-body experience, but it was proof that, using computer technology, the self-model could easily be manipulated. A new area of research had been created: virtual embodiment.
