Liberals tend to see it as something that needs to be fixed. Socialists see it as something to be defeated. They say they do, anyway. As we've seen, the Millennial socialist intellectuals aren't really calling for government takeover of industry. Still, their stated opposition to capitalism-as-such has consequences for how we address the problems of the modern economy.""

It takes will & effort!  [ . . . ] Political/policy analysis, when done well, is developed through dialog.  [ . . . ] It's a muscle that requires exercise. And ""objective"" reporters don't exercise it.

19 favorites (16 in the past 24 hours),"Who owns the space under cities? (The Guardian) Airspace ownership and control (Slate) is often discussed with regard to drones. When thinking subsurface, mineral rights (Geology.com) probably come to mind with extractive industries, but what about subterranean management? With city centers fully built, developers are looking down as well as up. Singapore has been doing subsurface planning since 2007 (Science Direct, abstract only) Hong Kong built underground caverns to expand its available real estate space (Wired) after maximizing surface and airspace development, and Helsinki has an underground masterplan (Hel.fi). British Geological Survey's Project Iceberg (BGS) aims to document and better manage underground developments in England.
