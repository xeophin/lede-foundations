This “talk about how you’re going to do and be better” stuff isn’t actually a great formula for reconciliation. It offers neither retributive nor restorative justice.

Rowley then called for action to address the issue of period poverty in the UK. Meanwhile, Member of Scottish Parliament Monica Lennon (Labour) has garnered support at 96% from all 5 parties for her bill proposing Scottish Parliament provide free menstrual supplies to everyone who needs them.",Scottish MP breaks taboo & discusses her period in House of Commons,https://www.metafilter.com/175126/Scottish-MP-breaks-taboo-and-discusses-her-period-in-House-of-Commons
