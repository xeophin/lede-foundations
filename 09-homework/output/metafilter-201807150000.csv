38 favorites,"A lingering dry spell has exposed a previously unknown monument in Ireland's Boyne Valley ... archaeologists confirmed the footprint of an ancient henge, or enclosure, that may be some 4,500 years old. Ireland is famously green... But this summer it's been gripped by an unusual heatwave and a lengthy dry spell. Crops are fading in the drought. And the unusual weather circumstances made the remarkable photos possible. 

In normal weather, the difference is undetectable — that's why Murphy had flown drones overhead before without noticing it. And even in a drought, it's too subtle to see from the ground. But combine the dry spell with the aerial view, and suddenly the outline is obvious.","In Ireland, Drought And A Drone Revealed The Outline Of An Ancient Henge",https://www.metafilter.com/175330/In-Ireland-Drought-And-A-Drone-Revealed-The-Outline-Of-An-Ancient-Henge

If someone in Santa Marianita was able to research the games they wanted, it’s unlikely they’d have the PC or console to play them, much less the internet speeds to keep them updated or play online with friends. But thanks to those small electronics stores in nearby Manta and the occasional console shipment on trucks inbound from distant Guayaquil, local kids and 20-somethings are circumventing some of these challenges and kindling a ferocious love for games.”",“...it doesn’t matter that there’s no Wi-Fi or online multiplayer.”,https://www.metafilter.com/175325/it-doesnt-matter-that-theres-no-Wi-Fi-or-online-multiplayer

23 favorites (8 in the past 24 hours),"In 2005, Metzinger put on a virtual-reality head-mounted display. Inside, he saw his own body, facing away from him, standing in a room. He watched as Lenggenhager stroked its back. Metzinger could feel the stroking, but the body to which it was happening seemed to be situated in front of him. He felt a strange sensation, as though he were drifting in space, or being stretched between the two bodies. He wanted to jump entirely into the body before him, but couldn’t. He seemed marooned outside of himself. It wasn’t quite an out-of-body experience, but it was proof that, using computer technology, the self-model could easily be manipulated. A new area of research had been created: virtual embodiment.
