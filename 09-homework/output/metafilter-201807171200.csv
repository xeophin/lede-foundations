A fiery, exacting journalist, she's best known for her work on documenting lynching (and the false premises used to justify it) in her books Southern Horrors and The Red Record , the latter of which is now seen as a pioneering work of early data journalism.  Now, a community group is working to create a monument to Wells in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, where she lived and worked.","The answer always is: ""Tell the world the facts.""",https://www.metafilter.com/175366/The-answer-always-is-Tell-the-world-the-facts

23 favorites,"David Roberts argues that  journalists' desire to appear unbiased impacts their ability to understand the substance: [I]magine covering substantive disputes every day but not allowing yourself to develop opinions about them. It takes will & effort!  [ . . . ] Political/policy analysis, when done well, is developed through dialog.  [ . . . ] It's a muscle that requires exercise. And ""objective"" reporters don't exercise it.

Instead, we focus on functions that take immutable values as input and produce new values as output. Given the same inputs, these functions always return the same results.

When thinking subsurface, mineral rights (Geology.com) probably come to mind with extractive industries, but what about subterranean management? With city centers fully built, developers are looking down as well as up. Singapore has been doing subsurface planning since 2007 (Science Direct, abstract only) Hong Kong built underground caverns to expand its available real estate space (Wired) after maximizing surface and airspace development, and Helsinki has an underground masterplan (Hel.fi). British Geological Survey's Project Iceberg (BGS) aims to document and better manage underground developments in England. Up next: tunnels to ease traffic congestion.","Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos",https://www.metafilter.com/175362/Cuius-est-solum-eius-est-usque-ad-coelum-et-ad-inferos
