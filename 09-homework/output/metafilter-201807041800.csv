""My cat, Tuffy stole a piece of bread off of the stove and put it in the floor next to the cabinet. She then stared at it intensely, and motionlessly for an hour. We thought that was creepy. Then a mouse came out from behind the cabinet to get the bread and she pounced it! She was using the bread as motherfucking bait! This is the same cat who routinely burns her tongue licking lightbulbs, hisses at them, and keeps licking.""",What's the most creepily intelligent thing your pet has ever done?,https://www.metafilter.com/175103/Whats-the-most-creepily-intelligent-thing-your-pet-has-ever-done

21 favorites (15 in the past 24 hours),""" I think a lot about how whales die. That might sound like the ranting of a whale bone chaser gone full Ahab, but my preoccupation is not with the gore of decaying flesh or exploding body cavities (although those don’t really bother me). Instead, I’m fascinated by the details of the what, where, how, and why: what happens to their carcasses, their locations when they expire, how whales perish, and the reasons for their demise. You might think that these facts are easily uncovered in the scientific literature, or in the many accounts of whaling on the high seas. But they aren’t, not for all of the whales that have washed up on the world’s shores or been hauled up by whalers."" - Nick Pyenson",What are you but a loose-fish and a fast-fish?,https://www.metafilter.com/175101/What-are-you-but-a-loose-fish-and-a-fast-fish
