elementary does not mean easy to understand. Elementary means that very
little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it,
except to have an infinite amount of intelligence.  There may be a large
number of steps that hard to follow, but to each does not require already
knowing the calculus or Fourier transforms. -- Richard P. Feynman This video recounts a lecture by Richard Feynman giving an elementary demonstration of why planets orbit in ellipses.

She began painting in an era when women didn’t, at an age when most people shouldn’t, traveling to remote locations that few professional adventurers chose to go. Not only did she adopt the painting techniques of modernism, when such ideas were considered dangerous, Carr chronicled the extraordinary art and culture of native peoples, who were invisible to the dominant culture, as described in the documentary Winds of Heaven (documentary trailer).","Emily Carr, a Canadian artist of stunning originality and strength",https://www.metafilter.com/175487/Emily-Carr-a-Canadian-artist-of-stunning-originality-and-strength

Founded by Generikb - who describes himself as a “ gaming hermit ” - in April 2012, the server had a rocky start, including losing the first map only a few episodes in. Regrouping, the Hermits started over, but “genny” would leave after a year to focus his time on the older Mindcrack server, to which he’d been invited half-way through the first Hermitcraft season (and which had been the impetus for starting his own survival multiplayer server). The rest of the Hermits carried on, before deciding to reset the map for an official “ Season 2 ” in June of 2013 as Minecraft’s “ Horse Update ” was approaching a proper release…",What’s the collective noun for hermits?,https://www.metafilter.com/175477/Whats-the-collective-noun-for-hermits
