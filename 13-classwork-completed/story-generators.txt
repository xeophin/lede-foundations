Generating story ideas
======================

You'll do this differently in the newsroom, but hey, why not have some sort of template.


1. Three general topics you're interested in

For example, nature



2. For each topic, three more specific topics. You don't have to be specifically interested in them, but it will help.

For example, nature: trees, soil, parks


3. For each of those 'more specific' topics, think of 3 questions, investigative topics, or visualizations ideas. *They don't need to be about data*

Trees
  - Map of all of the trees in New York City (simple visualization)
  - Deforestation in New Zealand (more specific topic)
  - Where has a deforested place grown its trees back? (question)



4. For some of your favorite topics, try to list 3 places you might go for data or people you might talk to for tips (WITHOUT GOOGLING, it's okay if you're terrible at this)

  Map of all of the trees in New York City:
    - New York Parks Department
    - Environmental Protection Agency
    - Citizen tree groups
  Deforestation in New Zealand:
    - New Zealand government
    - Environmental groups
  Where has a deforested place grown its trees back?
    - Research papers (Columbia library search)
    - Someone in the ecology/environmental stuff department???
    - I have no idea



5. What's the "at least" and the "nice to have" for each project?

  NYC trees
    minimum
      - X is the most popular tree in New York.
    nice to have
      - map of trees
      - bar graph of all of the trees
      - most popular trees by neighborhood

  Deforested places
    minimum
      - bar graph of trees in a single region comparing two years
    nice to have 
      - I find a lot of text and documents and shapefiles
      - make maps and line graphs over time

  Deforestation in New Zealand
    minimum
      - bar graph of before/after comparing two years
    nice to have
      - lots of words
      - map(s) of before/after
      - line graph with a lot of time
      - data about other places to compare


6. Share it with your group. What do they think?



7. Go try to find some data real quick. Did you find what you needed? How might you adjust your project?
