## The Pudding
No fixed publishing schedule

## Workflow
- Figma for sketches and design
- Design in Figma first, then realisation in code, no design in code
- story time: meeting, everyone has three pre-researched stories and pitches them, the others will give opinion and whether to pursue them

## Interaction Design
- Scrolling is something people do naturally, with buttons it's not clear if people actually will click them (or just abandon the story)
- If stuff can be done statically, then that's perfect as well â€“ not everything needs to be interactive
- Programming: mobile first
