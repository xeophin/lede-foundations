STEP ONE: You'll need to add your marks in the same way we did for the last problem. You can totally steal the code! What kind of elements do you use for a scatterplot?














Give them all the same position and radius at first, just to make sure they'll show up. It'll look like one circle because they'll all be on top of each other.












Be sure you're using cx and cy, not x and y!













STEP TWO: Build your scales. You'll need three - one for the x position, one for the color, and one for the radius.











Please call them xPositionScale and colorScale and radiusScale.














Two of them are normal number scales (halfway through the input = halfway through the output), which makes them linear scales. Another one is about categories (animal) turning into categories (color) - which kind is that?














 What's the max input and max output for each of them?











Make sure you're doing domain([0,1]) instead of domain(1,2)!













STEP THREE: Use the scales to position your circles












Remember, cx and cy, not x and y!














You want a different value for each one, right? So you might need our good friend function(d).

















STEP FOUR: Change the size and color of the circles.
