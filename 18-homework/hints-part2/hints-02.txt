Any time you're using .select or .selectAll with d3, you can also use .attr to change attributes.


















Just like we change attributes for svg elements (rect, circle, etc), you can also do the same thing with svgs. Heck, you could do it with divs or h1 tags or anything, too!

















I'd recommend going through the steps in order, and only doing one at a time.











"Every bar's width should be related to the gdp of the country. If the gdp is 100, it should be as wide as the SVG." - what does that mean in terms of expected min/max inputs and expected min/max outputs?














When you're passing the inputs and outputs to a scale, make sure you're sending a list. If you use .domain([1, 2]) it will work, if you use .domain(1, 2) it won't work.














Let's say you've already .selectAll'd something. If you want to change an attribute and have element be the SAME, it's .attr('blah', 10). If you want them to be DIFFERENT, you use

.attr('blah', function(d) {
  return something that probably uses a scale
})











If you get the error 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'gdp' of undefined' or something like that, make sure you did the .data(blahblah) thing to teach your rectangles about your dataset!












Yes, the length of a bar is 'width', not 'length'












Pay attention to your JavaScript console, it will (kind of try to) show you helpful error messages.
