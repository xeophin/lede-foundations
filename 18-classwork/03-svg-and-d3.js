  // Remember, scales allow us to map an INPUT (a domain) to an OUTPUT (a range).

  // For example, I'm going to have input values of 0-4500 (square miles), please give me back
  //   the appropriate size for a circle, between 0 and 100. A 0 sqmi city would have a 0 radius,
  //   while a 4500 sqmi city would have a radius of 100 pixels.

  // You can also use scales to say "I'm going to give you a number between 4 and 15, and you're
  //    going to give me back a color between beige and red." We can get fancy with our colors and use
  //    hex codes from colorbrewer.

  // The answer to every question is probably "function(d) { }"
