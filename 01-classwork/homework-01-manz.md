The classwork had a file named "OSHA fatalities FY2017.csv". Use this file to answer the following questions. Submit as a plain-text file named homework-01-lastname.txt with both the answers and a list of commands you used to get them.

1. How many accidents are in the file?

```bash
head OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv 
wc -l OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv
```

396 fatalities (398 lines, minus header and empty line below header and 
assuming that there are no other empty lines throughout the file)

2. I want to know what companies were involved in explosions. Can you search the file to only show falls?

```bash
grep -i explosion OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv |Â wc -l
```

9

3. I would like a file of only 2017 accidents. How many lines is in it?

```bash
grep /2017 OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv | wc -l
```

120

4. What command would I use to show me ONLY the first line of the file?

```bash
head -n 1 OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv
```

5. How many accidents involved forklifts? Also, save them to a file.

```bash
grep forklift -i OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv | wc -l
grep forklift -i OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv > forklift-accidents.csv
```

12


6. How many accidents were on Christmas Eve? Also, save them to a file.

```bash
grep 12/24 OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv | wc -l
grep 12/25 OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv > christmas-accidents.csv
```

2

7. I need a text file of accidents that involve trees!

```bash
grep ' tree' OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv > trees.csv
```

(This of course assumes that those trees are not specified in more details, 
so all the workers that have been impaled by firs are unfortunately missing 
here. This might skip over cases where the description takes the form of 
"Tree fell on worker", or similar.)
